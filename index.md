# 👋 Welcome

Welcome to my personal archive.
[cite_start]I am **Wonseok Whi, M.D., Ph.D.**, currently working as a Clinical Assistant Professor at the **Department of Nuclear Medicine, Samsung Medical Center**[cite: 5, 11].

My research bridges the gap between clinical nuclear medicine and computational analysis, with a special focus on brain connectomics and prognostic modeling using PET/CT.

## 🔬 Research Interests
1. **Brain Connectomics:** Hyperbolic embedding & Network analysis of fMRI
2. **Clinical Nuclear Medicine:** Prognostic value of PET/CT in Oncology (Lung, Breast, Pancreas)
3. **Medical AI:** Deep learning-based image analysis

## 🌟 Selected Work (Highlight)
### [Hyperbolic Disc Embedding of Functional Human Brain Connectomes]
**"Geometric representation of the brain's functional network"**

This study proposes a novel method to embed human brain functional connectomes into a hyperbolic space. By utilizing **hyperbolic disc embedding**, we revealed the hierarchical organization and core-periphery structure of resting-state fMRI networks, offering new insights into brain topology.
