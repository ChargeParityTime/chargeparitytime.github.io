# 👋 Welcome

Welcome to my personal archive.
I am **Wonseok Whi, M.D., Ph.D.**, currently working as a Clinical Assistant Professor at the **Department of Nuclear Medicine, Samsung Medical Center**.

My research bridges the gap between clinical nuclear medicine and computational analysis, with a special focus on brain connectomics and prognostic modeling using PET/CT.

## 🔬 Research Interests
1. **Brain Connectomics:** Hyperbolic embedding & Network analysis of fMRI
2. **Clinical Nuclear Medicine:** Prognostic value of PET/CT in Oncology
3. **Medical AI:** Deep learning-based image analysis

## 🌟 Selected Work (Highlight)
### [Hyperbolic Disc Embedding of Functional Human Brain Connectomes]
This study proposes a novel method to embed human brain functional connectomes into a hyperbolic space. By utilizing **hyperbolic disc embedding**, we revealed the hierarchical organization of resting-state fMRI networks.

Additionally, we identified characteristic functional cores using k-core percolation analysis, offering new insights into brain topology.

## 📚 Recent Clinical Studies
I am also actively conducting clinical research to predict patient outcomes using metabolic imaging.

### 1. Prognosis in Pancreatic Cancer
We analyzed the prognostic value of pseudotime from texture parameters of [18F]FDG PET/CT in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

### 2. Pulmonary Fibrosis Analysis
We investigated the prognostic value of PET/CT in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
