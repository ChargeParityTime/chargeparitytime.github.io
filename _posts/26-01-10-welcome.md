## First Post

I am building a website using Gemini, GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
It serves as a minimal archive for my research works and personal thoughts on physics and medicine.

I plan to upload occasional updates about:
* Personal lifes
* Study notes on **Quantum Mechanics** or **Mathematical Physics**
